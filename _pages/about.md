My name is Chenyue (Jim) Li. I'm an incoming PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at HKUST, under the supervision of [Prof Binhang YUAN](https://binhangyuan.github.io/site/). My research interest primarily focuses on AI for Science(AI4S), aiming to boost the scientific discovery by leveraging the power of AI. Additionally, I also have complementary background in database， distributed Systems, cybersecurity and full-stack development.
